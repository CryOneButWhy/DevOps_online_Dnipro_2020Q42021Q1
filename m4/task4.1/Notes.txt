First part is done.
On step 4 now.
Sending packets 

4. Checked ICMP packets send via Simulation mode 
In this simulation we see a classical hub working.
Message goes from one PC to hub, it sends message to every PC. Only PC which should receive package will be able to receive it.

Deleting IP addresses from pcs
Deleted. Testing the network 
Withut IPs no packages are being delivered to any device. Every device in a network requires address if you wish to send packets based on IP protocol

Creating scheme 9 
Testing packets movement.
Hubs are communicating via MAC address ?
When device gots required packet, it sends some kind of a reply ?
Какой-то ответ, который затрагивает только физ слой ОСИ

Creating scheme 12 
13. Analyzing scheme 
Yes, it sends reply that message is received to source PC.
Switch sends message directly to the required PC.

Creating Project 13 
Here we see that PC 0 does not see PC destination as it is located in different behind switch ??
If ICMP package should be delivered to PC connected to the same switch, it sees it on OSI layer 3 


19 - We have divided one network to 2 networks 
Configured router with IP - 192.168.0.5 for 192.168.0.0 network 
192.168.1.5 for 192.168.1.0 network
Activated port 

It all works. Having 192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24 means that we have 2 different networks.
Router allows us to conenct 2 different networks or even divide one network into several subnets.

Its all done
